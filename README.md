# Chatbot Types: Rule-Based and Self-Learning

This repository provides an overview of two prominent chatbot categories: **Rule-Based** and **Self-Learning** chatbots. These chatbot architectures are foundational for developing conversational AI systems. Each type uses different approaches to handle user interactions and responses.

## 1. Rule-Based Chatbots
Rule-Based Chatbots operate on predefined rules and patterns to determine responses. They follow a structured flowchart or decision tree based on user inputs.

### **Characteristics**
- Predefined rules and keyword matching.
- Limited flexibility and adaptability.
- Suitable for simple, predictable conversations.

### **Tech Stack**
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript.
- **Frameworks and Libraries**:
  - **Rasa** (open-source conversational AI platform).
  - **Dialogflow (by Google)** for intent-based conversational flows.
  - **Microsoft Bot Framework**.
- **Tools**:
  - **Regex-based pattern matching**.
  - **Finite state machines (FSM)** for managing dialogue states.

### **Example Use Cases**
- Customer support with limited FAQs.
- Basic appointment scheduling.

## 2. Self-Learning Chatbots
Self-Learning Chatbots leverage machine learning and AI to improve responses over time. These chatbots do not rely on hard-coded rules but learn from data.

### **Characteristics**
- Adaptable and capable of handling dynamic conversations.
- Uses AI models to understand user intent and generate responses.
- Requires continuous training and large datasets.

### **Tech Stack**
- **Languages**: Python, Java, JavaScript.
- **Frameworks and Libraries**:
  - **TensorFlow, PyTorch** for deep learning models.
  - **OpenAI GPT** or similar large language models.
  - **spaCy** and **NLTK** for Natural Language Processing (NLP).
- **Databases**:
  - NoSQL databases like MongoDB for storing conversation logs.
  - SQL-based databases for structured data.
- **Cloud and Deployment Tools**:
  - AWS Lex, Google Cloud NLP, and Azure Bot Services.

### **Example Use Cases**
- Virtual personal assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa).
- Conversational customer support with dynamic intent handling.
