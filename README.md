### Rule-Based Chatbots

Rule-based chatbots operate on predefined rules and workflows. They are suitable for simple tasks and follow a fixed conversation path.

#### 1. Menu/Tree-Based Chatbot
**Description:** Uses a decision tree model where users select from predefined options to navigate.

**Use Cases:**
- Customer service (FAQ automation)
- Appointment scheduling

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Backend: Python, Flask/Node.js
- Database: SQLite, MySQL
- Libraries: Botpress, Rasa (rule-based flows)

#### 2. Keyword Recognition-Based Chatbot
**Description:** Responds to keywords detected in user input to determine the response.

**Use Cases:**
- Technical support
- Lead generation

**Tech Stack:**
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLTK, SpaCy
- Backend: Python, Django
- Database: PostgreSQL

#### 3. Pattern Matching Chatbot
**Description:** Uses pattern matching with a template-based response model.

**Use Cases:**
- Interactive storytelling
- Information retrieval

**Tech Stack:**
- Language: Python (Regex), AIML
- Libraries: PyAIML
- Framework: ChatterBot (custom logic patterns)

### Self-Learning Chatbots

Self-learning chatbots leverage machine learning models to improve over time and handle dynamic conversations.

#### 1. Contextual Chatbot
**Description:** Maintains context between messages using contextual NLP.

**Use Cases:**
- Conversational commerce
- Virtual assistants

**Tech Stack:**
- Machine Learning: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- NLP: HuggingFace Transformers, BERT
- Backend: Flask, FastAPI
- Database: MongoDB

#### 2. Generative Chatbot
**Description:** Generates responses based on learned models rather than predefined replies.

**Use Cases:**
- Creative writing assistance
- Personalized chatbots

**Tech Stack:**
- Deep Learning: GPT-3, LSTM, Seq2Seq
- Frameworks: OpenAI API, PyTorch Lightning
- Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy

#### 3. Retrieval-Based Chatbot
**Description:** Selects appropriate responses from a predefined set using a matching algorithm.

**Use Cases:**
- Automated customer support
- Knowledge base assistance

**Tech Stack:**
- NLP Models: Sentence-BERT
- Libraries: scikit-learn, FAISS for similarity search
- Backend: Python, Flask
